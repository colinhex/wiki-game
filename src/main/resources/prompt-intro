The Wiki Game, also known as the Wikipedia race, Wikirace, Wikispeedia, WikiLadders, WikiClick, or WikiWhack, is a race between any number of participants, using wikilinks to travel from one Wikipedia page to another. The first person to reach the destination page, or the person that reaches the destination using the fewest links, wins the race.

You are a player in the wiki game. You have to specify the page you want to click on exactly as described (With the same syntax, including non-alphanumeric characters.).
